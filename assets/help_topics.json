  "Introduction": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p>S-Mapper is a user-friendly application for remapping input events so you can adapt your mouse and keyboard behavior to different applications or workflows. It lets you define mappings that are active only when a target window (by title) is focused, so you can customize per-application controls without changing global behavior.</p><p>This help index explains the core features, common use-cases, tips for reliability, and how to troubleshoot problems.</p><h2>Key Concepts</h2><ul><li><b>Mappings</b> - Map a source trigger (keyboard key or mouse click pattern) to a keyboard action.</li><li><b>Target Window</b> - A case-insensitive substring used to scope the mapping to a particular application window.</li><li><b>Low-level suppression</b> - Optional method to suppress the original keypress and inject a different key at a lower level (may need admin).</li></ul>",

  "Mouse Mappings": "<h1>Mouse to Keyboard Mapping</h1><p>Use this when you want a mouse button (e.g., double-click) to act like a keyboard shortcut inside a particular application.</p><h2>How to set it up</h2><ol><li>Choose the mouse button from the dropdown (left/right/middle/x1/x2).</li><li>Set the number of presses required (e.g., 2 for double-click).</li><li>Pick the target keyboard key and optional modifier(s) to be synthesized.</li><li>Set the target window substring so the mapping only applies when that app is active.</li><li>Click <b>Add Mapping</b> then test in the target app.</li></ol><h2>Real-world Examples</h2><ul><li>Map <b>double-left-click</b> to <b>Ctrl+F</b> inside a text editor to quickly open find.</li><li>Map <b>side button (x1)</b> to <b>Alt+Tab</b> for fast app switching in a particular game window.</li></ul><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Keep target window titles specific enough to avoid accidental matches.</li><li>Adjust the click-interval setting if you find your double-clicks aren't reliably detected.</li></ul>",

  "Keyboard Mappings": "<h1>Keyboard to Keyboard Mapping</h1><p>Remap one key (the source) to another key or key combination (the target), scoped to a specific target window.</p><h2>Use-cases</h2><ul><li>Make <b>F12</b> behave like <b>Esc</b> in an older fullscreen app that doesn't handle Esc consistently.</li><li>Map <b>Caps Lock</b> to <b>Ctrl</b> in a terminal window to speed up shortcuts.</li></ul><h2>Best practices</h2><ol><li>Prefer lower-case names when entering keys — the app normalizes keys internally.</li><li>If you need to remap complex hotkeys, include modifier keys in the target (e.g., <code>ctrl + alt + d</code>).</li><li>When using low-level suppression (advanced), keep mappings small and targeted to avoid interfering with OS/global hotkeys.</li></ol>",

  "Ping Monitor": "<h1>Clipboard IP Ping Monitor</h1><p>The IP Ping Monitor watches your clipboard and, when you copy an IPv4 address while the configured target window is active, it executes a ping and displays results. This is useful for quick network checks while working in applications such as game clients, remote tools, or admin consoles.</p><h2>How to use</h2><ol><li>Enter a substring of the window title you want to monitor in the \"Target Window Contains\" field (e.g., <i>\"MyGame\"</i>).</li><li>Click <b>Start Monitoring</b>.</li><li>Copy an IPv4 address to the clipboard while that window is active — the app auto-pings and shows the result in the Ping Log.</li></ol><h2>Why this is useful</h2><ul><li>Quickly check server reachability without leaving your active application.</li><li>Keep a log of past pings in the Ping Log tab, including full command output.</li></ul><h2>Limitations</h2><ul><li>Parsing ping output relies on common Windows output formats — in rare locales or OS variants you may see different phrasing; the app errs on the side of conservatively treating non-empty responses as success.</li><li>For extremely robust checks consider using a native ICMP library or a direct socket probe if you need cross-locale guarantees.</li></ul>",

  "Low-Level Suppression": "<h1>Low-Level Keyboard Suppression</h1><p>This advanced feature installs per-key low-level intercepts that allow S-Mapper to suppress the original keypress and inject a different sequence. It is intended for situations where regular simulated key events are not accepted (some games or protected apps).</p><h2>Important considerations</h2><ul><li>May require running the app as administrator on Windows to install global hooks reliably.</li><li>Low-level hooks can interfere with OS-level hotkeys (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+Del), so use them sparingly and target only the keys you need.</li><li>When enabling, the app will attempt to register hooks and will notify you if the attempt fails.</li></ul><h2>Example</h2><p>If a game doesn't accept programmatic Ctrl+Shift+F, use low-level suppression to intercept a source key and emit the exact sequence while preventing the original key from reaching the app.</p>",

  "Examples": "<h1>Practical Examples</h1><p>Here are some real mappings people commonly create:</p><ul><li><b>Make a mouse side button send Ctrl+C</b> inside a selected editor window to create a quick copy action there only.</li><li><b>Map a double-right-click to Alt+Enter</b> in a developer tool to toggle a console.</li><li><b>Remap caps-lock to Ctrl in the terminal</b> to make shortcuts more comfortable.</li></ul>",

  "Troubleshooting": "<h1>Troubleshooting & Common Issues</h1><h2>Mappings not working</h2><ul><li>Verify the matching target window string is correct and specific. The match is case-insensitive and substring-based.</li><li>If using low-level suppression, ensure the app has the privileges required on Windows (try running elevated).</li><li>Check the Ping Log / Error Log for any failures or diagnostic messages.</li></ul><h2>Key repeats or loops</h2><p>If you see repeated events, the app tries to protect against synthetic input loops using a short ignore window. If loops happen, ensure your target mapping doesn't re-emit its source or conflict with modifier checks.</p>",

  "Best Practices": "<h1>Best Practices</h1><ul><li>Keep mappings scoped to specific windows — avoid using very short, generic window titles that could match many apps.</li><li>When possible prefer keyboard-to-keyboard mappings for consistency; mouse patterns are great for quick in-app shortcuts.</li><li>Only enable low-level suppression for keys that truly require it — it's more powerful but riskier than the default high-level path.</li><li>Use the Ping Log and error log (in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\S-Mapper\\error.log) to diagnose unexpected behavior.</li></ul>"
